# Study hours outside class contact

&gt; "The study hours for each credit point is 10 hours. For a 30-credit module this equates to 300 hours. Therefore, if a module has time-tabled activities i.e. lecture/seminar/lab, of 3 hours per week for a 24-week period (total of 72 hours), then the out-of-class study commitment expected of students is 228 hours in total." - Course Handbook.

* Practical meaning: 300 hours = **2.5 hours per day** x *5 days* x 24 learning weeks (Note: only 18 learning weeks for Hong Kong)

# Master's degree in UK

&gt; "[A] master's [degree] is hard work and requires a lot of commitment. It has to be something you actively want to do . . . Postgraduate study is *much more independent* than undergraduate study, so, on a practical level, it is important to be aware that you may be *working by yourself for much of the time*." - [Taking the plunge into the master's world (The Guardian, 2009)](http://bit.ly/2fBScEa)

# Public Contracts Directive (2014/24/EU)

* Article 2(1) definitions

&gt; "(10) 'economic operator' means any natural or legal person or public entity or group of such persons and/or entities, including any temporary association of undertakings, which offers the execution of works and/or a work, the supply of products or the provision of services on the market"

* Preamble

&gt; "(14) It should be clarified that the notion of 'economic operators' should be interpreted in a broad manner so as to include any persons and/or entities which offer the execution of works, the supply of products or the provision of services on the market, irrespective of the legal form under which they have chosen to operate. Thus, firms, branches, subsidiaries, partnerships, cooperative societies, limited companies, universities, public or private, and other forms of entities than natural persons should all fall within the notion of economic operator, whether or not they are 'legal persons' in all circumstances."

---

# Public Contracts Directive (2014/24/EU)

* Article 57(1) exclusion

&gt; "(1) Contracting authorities shall exclude an economic operator from participation in a procurement procedure where they have established, by verifying in accordance with Articles 59, 60 and 61, or are otherwise aware that that economic operator has been the subject of a conviction by final judgment for one of the [6] reasons:"

&gt; "The obligation to exclude an economic operator shall also apply where the person convicted by final judgment is a member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of that economic operator or has powers of representation, decision or control therein."

---

# Public Contracts Directive (2014/24/EU)

* 6 reasons

---

# Public Contracts Directive (2014/24/EU)

* Article 57(2) exclusion

&gt; "An economic operator shall be excluded from participation in a procurement procedure where the contracting authority is aware that the economic operator is in breach of its obligations relating to the payment of taxes or social security contributions and where this has been established by a judicial or administrative decision having final and binding effect in accordance with the legal provisions of the country in which it is established or with those of the Member State of the contracting authority."

---

# Public Contracts Directive (2014/24/EU)

* Article 57(3) derogation from exclusion

&gt; "Member States may provide for a derogation from the mandatory exclusion provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2, on an exceptional basis, for overriding reasons relating to the public interest such as public health or protection of the environment."

&gt; "Member States may also provide for a derogation from the mandatory exclusion provided in paragraph 2, where an exclusion would be clearly disproportionate, in particular where only minor amounts of taxes or social security contributions are unpaid or where the economic operator was informed of the exact amount due following its breach of its obligations relating to the payment of taxes or social security contributions at such time that it did not have the possibility of taking measures as provided for in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 before expiration of the deadline for requesting participation or, in open procedures, the deadline for submitting its tender."

---

# Public Contracts Directive (2014/24/EU)

* Article 57(6) further condition not to exclude

&gt; "Any economic operator that is in one of the situations referred to in paragraphs 1 (and 4) may provide evidence to the effect that measures taken by the economic operator are sufficient to demonstrate its reliability despite the existence of a relevant ground for exclusion. If such evidence is considered as sufficient, the economic operator concerned shall not be excluded from the procurement procedure. For this purpose, the economic operator shall prove that it has paid or undertaken to pay compensation in respect of any damage caused by the criminal offence or misconduct, clarified the facts and circumstances in a comprehensive manner by actively collaborating with the investigating authorities and taken concrete technical, organisational and personnel measures that are appropriate to prevent further criminal offences or misconduct. . ."

---

# Public Contracts Directive (2014/24/EU)

* Article 57(6) further condition not to exclude

&gt; ". . . The measures taken by the economic operators shall be evaluated taking into account the gravity and particular circumstances of the criminal offence or misconduct. Where the measures are considered to be insufficient, the economic operator shall receive a statement of the reasons for that decision. An economic operator which has been excluded by final judgment from participating in procurement or concession award procedures shall not be entitled to make use of the possibility provided for under this paragraph during the period of exclusion resulting from that judgment in the Member States where the judgment is effective."

# MoJ Guidance

---

# Introduction

* Guidance about procedures which relevant commercial organisations can put into place to prevent persons associated with them from bribing

* [MoJ Guidance](http://bit.ly/1fmzCor)

---

# Section 1

* Hospitality intended as a bribe

&gt; "Prosecution would need to show that the hospitality was intended to induce conduct that amounts to a breach of an expectation that a person will act in good faith, impartially, or in accordance with a position of trust. This would be judged by what a reasonable person in the UK thought." (G)

---

# Section 6

* Policy

&gt; "The need to prohibit the influencing of decision making in the context of publicly funded business opportunities by the inducement of personal enrichment of foreign public officials or to others at the official's request, assent or acquiescence." (G)

---

# Section 6 does not require proof of:

* Very likely to involve conduct which amounts to "improper performance" of a relevant function or activity to which section 1 applies

* an intention to induce the above mentioned conduct

---

# Section 6

* Section 6 is unlike section 1 because:

&gt; "the exact nature of the functions of persons regarded as foreign public officials is often very difficult to ascertain with any accuracy, and the securing of evidence will often be reliant on the cooperation of the state any such officials serve. To require the prosecution to rely entirely on section 1 would amount to a very significant deficiency in the ability of the legislation to address this particular mischief."

---

# Six principles to help to decide whether or not adequate procedures have been taken

* Proportionality

* Top Level Commitment

* Risk Assessmnet

* Due Diligence

* Communication

* Monitoring and Review

---

# Principle 1

* Proportionate procedures

&gt; "A commercial organisation's procedures to
prevent bribery by persons associated with it are proportionate to the bribery risks it faces and to the nature, scale and complexity of the commercial organisation's activities. They are also clear, practical, accessible, effectively implemented and enforced." (G)

---

# Principle 1

* Proportionate procedures

&gt; "The action you take should be proportionate to the risks you face and to the size of your business. So you might need to do more to prevent bribery if your organisation is large, or if you are operating in an overseas market where bribery is known to be commonplace, compared to what you might do if your organisation is small, or is operating in markets where bribery is not prevalent." (QS)

---

# Principle 2

* Top-level commitment

&gt; "The top-level management of a commercial organisation (be it a board of directors, the owners or any other equivalent body or person) are committed to preventing bribery by persons associated with it. They foster a culture within the organisation in which bribery is never acceptable." (G)

---

# Principle 2

* Top-level commitment

&gt; "Those at the top of an organisation are in the best position to ensure their organisation conducts business without bribery. If you are running a business, you will want to show that you have been active in making sure that your staff (including any middle management) and the key people who do business with you and for you understand that you do not tolerate bribery. You may also want to get personally involved in taking the necessary proportionate action to address any bribery risks." (QS)

---

# Principle 3

* Risk assessment

&gt; "The commercial organisation assesses the nature and extent of its exposure to potential external and internal risks of bribery on its behalf by persons associated with it. The assessment is periodic, informed and documented." (G)

---

# Principle 3

* Risk assessment

&gt; "Think about the bribery risks you might face. For example, you might want to do some research into the markets you operate in and the people you deal with, especially if you are entering into new business arrangements and new markets overseas" (QS)

---

# Principle 4

* Due diligence

&gt; "The commercial organisation applies due diligence procedures, taking a proportionate and risk based approach, in respect of persons who perform or will perform services for or on behalf of the organisation, in order to mitigate identified bribery risks."

---

# Principle 4

* Due diligence

&gt; "Knowing exactly who you are dealing with can help to protect your organisation from taking on people who might be less than trustworthy. You may therefore want to ask a few questions and do a few checks before engaging others to represent you in business dealings." (QS)

---

# Principle 5

* Communication (including training)

&gt; "The commercial organisation seeks to ensure that its bribery prevention policies and procedures are embedded and understood throughout the organisation through internal and external communication, including training, that is proportionate to the risks it faces." (G)

---

# Principle 5

* Communication

&gt; "Communicating your policies and procedures to staff and to others who will perform services for you enhances awareness and helps to deter bribery by making clear the basis on which your organisation does business. You may, therefore, want to think about whether additional training or awareness raising would be appropriate or proportionate to the size and type of your business." (QS)

---

# Deferred Prosecution Agreement

---

# Introduction

* In May 2012, the Ministry of Justice published a consultation on proposals for a new tool to deal with corporate economic crime, known as [Deferred Prosecution Agreements](http://bit.ly/2iXOtTi).

* On 23 October 2012, the UK Government published its response to the consultation

* Section 45 and Schedule 17 of the [Crime and Courts Act 2013](http://bit.ly/2d94jDF) make provision about deferred prosecution agreements.

* On 14 February 2014, the Director of the Serious Fraud Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions published guidance to prosecutors on the use of DPA

* On 24 February 2014, section 45 and Schedule 15 came into force by the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (Commencement No. 8) Order 2014

---

# Procedures

* (1) Prosecutor concludes DPA is appropriate and sends entity to be subjected to DPA (P) a letter of invitation to negotiate

    +  P refuses to negotiate

    +  Then no DPA

* (2) If P accepts, prosecutor sends P a letter of undertaking and DPA negotiation period begins

    +  Either party may decide to withdraw from the process

    +  Then no DPA

* (3) Preliminary hearing at the Crown Court

* (4) Terms of DPA agreed and application made for final hearing

* (5) . . . 

---

# Procedures

* (5) Final hearing at the Crown Court

* (6) DPA in place and publication

    +  Breach

    +  Variation

* (7) DPA expires

* (8) Notice of discontinuance

---

# Procedures

* Variation

    +  Prosecutor and P agree to vary the terms of the DPA

    +  Prosecutors applies to court seeking declaration that variation is acceptable

* Breach

    +  Prosecutor considers entering discussions with P to rectify the breach

    +  Agreement

    +  No agreement

---

# Procedures

* Prosecution agrees with P that breach is adequately rectified

* No agreement is reached: prosecutor applies to Court for finding that P is in breach

    +  Court finds breach and invites parties to propose suitable remedy

    +  Court finds breach and terminate DPA and prosecution applies to lift suspension of indictment

---

# DPA is a discretionary tool

* Prosecutor may invite P to enter into negotiations to agree a DPA as an alternative to prosecution.

* An invitation to negotiate a DPA is a matter for the prosecutor's discretion. P has no right to be invited to negotiate a DPA.

---

# (1) Prosecutor considers whether DPA is appropriate

* Stage 1 evidential stage: the prosecutor must satisfy itself that there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction; OR there is at least a reasonable suspicion that the commercial organisation has committed the offence, and there are reasonable grounds for believing that a continued investigation would provide further evidence within a reasonable period of time, so that all the evidence together would be capable of establishing a realistic prospect of conviction.

* Stage 2 public interest stage: the public interest must be properly served by the prosecutor entering into a DPA with P instead of prosecuting

# (1) Prosecutor considers whether DPA is appropriate

* Additional public interest factors *in favour of* prosecution

    +  A history of similar conduct including prior criminal, civil and regulatory enforcement.

    +  Failure to report wrongdoing within a reasonable time of the conduct coming to light.

    +  Failure to report the full extent of the wrongdoing or reporting it inaccurately or in a misleading way.

    +  Ineffective corporate compliance programme
    
    + . . .

---

# (1) Prosecutor considers whether DPA is appropriate

* Additional public interest factors *in favour of* prosecution

    +  The conduct alleged is part of established business practices.

    +  Having been previously subject to warning, sanction or criminal charge and failure to take remedial action.

    +  Causing significant harm to the victims, or a substantial adverse impact on the integrity or confidence of markets or the government.

---

# (1) Prosecutor considers whether DPA is appropriate

* Additional public interest factors *against* prosecution

    +  Lacking history of similar conduct including prior criminal, civil and regulatory enforcement

* Additional public interest factors against prosecution

    +    . . .  regulatory enforcement

    +  The offending represents isolated actions by individuals.
    
    +  The offending is not recent in nature, and P in its current form is effectively a different body to that which committed the offences.

# [First UK DPA case: Standard Bank PLC](http://bit.ly/29jtrsW)

&gt; "   . . . key officials at ST (Standard Bank's sister bank in Tanzania), chief executive Bashir Awale and head of corporate and investment banking Shose Sinare, were able to increase the cost of the $600m sovereign loan by an additional 1% fee to be paid to a company EGMA Ltd.   . . . Almost all of the $6m paid into EGMA's account was withdrawn in cash days after the transaction concluded. Staff at ST raised concerns to Standard Bank London about the payments and the bank reported its concerns to the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the SFO the following day." ([reported by the Law Society Gazette](http://bit.ly/2i8JEFx))

# [First UK DPA case: Standard Bank PLC](http://bit.ly/29jtrsW)

&gt; "Standard Bank PLC (now known as ICBC Standard Bank Plc) ("Standard Bank"), was the subject of an indictment alleging failure to prevent bribery contrary to section 7 of the Bribery Act 2010. This indictment, pursuant to DPA proceedings, was immediately suspended on 30 November 2015. As a result of the DPA, Standard Bank were ordered to pay financial orders of US$25.2 million and required to pay the Government of Tanzania a further US$7 million in compensation. The bank also agreed to pay the SFO's reasonable costs of £330,000 in relation to the investigation and subsequent resolution of the DPA."

---

# [First UK DPA case: Standard Bank PLC](http://bit.ly/29jtrsW)

&gt; "The suspended charge related to a US$6 million payment by a former sister company of Standard Bank, Stanbic Bank Tanzania, in March 2013 to a local partner in Tanzania, Enterprise Growth Market Advisors (EGMA). The SFO alleged that the payment was intended to induce members of the Government of Tanzania, to show favour to Stanbic Tanzania and Standard Bank's proposal for a US$600 million private placement to be carried out on behalf of the Government of Tanzania. The placement generated transaction fees of US$8.4 million, shared by Stanbic Tanzania and Standard Bank. Standard Bank agreed to continue to cooperate fully with the SFO and to be subject to an independent review of its existing anti-bribery and corruption controls, policies and procedures regarding compliance with the Bribery Act 2010 and other applicable anti-corruption laws. It is required to implement recommendations of the independent reviewer (Price Waterhouse Coopers LLP).

&gt; This landmark case saw the UK's first DPA and use of section 7 in the Bribery Act 2010 by any prosecutor."

&gt; "A UK subsidiary of an unnamed US Company   . . . [subsidiary's] parent company implemented a global compliance programme in late 2011. In August 2012, this compliance programme resulted in concerns being raised within the business about the way in which a number of contracts had been secured.   . . . The [subsidiary] took immediate action, retaining a law firm that undertook an independent internal investigation. The law firm delivered a report to the SFO on 31 January 2013, after which the SFO conducted its own investigation." ([Reported by the Law Society Gazette](http://bit.ly/2jjdDbG))

# [Second UK DPA case](http://bit.ly/29nxYqV)

&gt; "The counterparty to the DPA is a UK SME that cannot currently be named due to ongoing, related legal proceedings.

&gt; The SME was the subject of an indictment alleging conspiracy to corrupt, contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977, conspiracy to bribe, contrary to section 1 of the same Act, and failure to prevent bribery, contrary to section 7 of the Bribery Act 2010, all in connection with contracts to supply its products to customers in a number of foreign jurisdictions.

&gt; This indictment, pursuant to DPA proceedings, was immediately suspended.

&gt; As a result of the DPA, the company will pay financial orders of £6,553,085, comprised of a £6,201,085 disgorgement of gross profits and a £352,000 financial penalty. £1,953,085 of the disgorgement will be paid by the SME's US registered parent company as repayment of a significant proportion of the dividends that it received from the SME over the indictment period."

# [Rolls-Royce PLC](http://bit.ly/2eNAZXN)

&gt; "Rolls-Royce was involved in corruption to land major contracts, an investigation has alleged.

&gt; The claim was made in a BBC documentary, which said that Rolls-Royce hired a network of agents and used bribes in order to land contracts in 12 countries."

&gt; "The documentary, produced with The Guardian, called Panorama: How Rolls-Royce Bribed Its Way Around The World, alleged that payments of around £10m were made to an unregistered Indian agent, and that the company made a suspicious payment which may have helped it win a major contract to build engines for Hawk aircraft."

&gt; "The investigation also claims that that agents were hired in Brazil, India, China, Indonesia, South Africa, Angola, Iraq, Iran, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia." (reported by the Telegraph)

# [Rolls-Royce PLC](http://bit.ly/2macN5i)

&gt; "Following a four year investigation, the SFO and Rolls-Royce entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) which was approved by Sir Brian Leveson, President of the Queen's Bench Division on 17 January 2017.  The DPA enables Rolls-Royce to account to a UK court for criminal conduct spanning three decades in seven jurisdictions and involving three business sectors.

&gt; The DPA involves payments of £497,252,645 (comprising disgorgement of profits of £258,170,000 and a financial penalty of £239,082,645) plus interest. Rolls-Royce are also reimbursing the SFO's costs in full (c£13m).

# Advantage:

* Avoids conviction if requirements fulfilled

* Avoids reputation damage that come with a conviction

---

# Purpose

* incentives for corporates to self-report

* reduce financial burden of lengthy investigations and prosecutions

---

# Purpose

&gt; "A DPA is not a private plea "deal" or "bargain" between the prosecutor and the company. It is a way in which a company accounts for its alleged offending to a criminal court, and can have no effect until a judge confirms in open court that the DPA is in the interests of justice and that its terms are fair, reasonable and proportionate, pursuant to paragraph 8(1) Schedule 17 Crime and Courts Act 2013."

# [Risk Assessment](http://bit.ly/2CmiHtK)

&gt; "Preventing and countering bribery cannot be carried out effectively without knowing the range of bribery risks facing the company and deciding which are the most significant to address. The risk assessment process is a systematic way of assessing bribery risks and is used to design the anti-bribery controls forming the anti-bribery programme."

---

# Key elements of risk assessment

* Focus on the highest risks: Resources are necessarily limited so concentrate on the risks that are judged highest.

* Evaluate bribery risks realistically: Use a framework and criteria to make realistic and consistent assessments of likelihood and impact.

* Repeated process: Conduct periodic risk assessments to ensure the controls remain adequate for any changes that may affect the business and position this as part of a continuous improvement process.

---

# Six stages for the anti-bribery risk assessment process

&gt; "1. Ensure top level commitment and oversight: Top level commitment is key to effective risk management. The board and senior management provide leadership and commitment to drive adequate and continuing risk assessment and ensure the process does not falter or lose quality."

&gt; "2. Plan, scope and mobilise: The planning stage prepares the ground for the risk assessment process. A planning team should consider the following aspects: appointing the project lead, defining stakeholders, allocating team responsibilities, identifying information sources drafting plan for risk assessment, communicating plan and requirements to those involved in the exercise."

---

# Six stages for the anti-bribery risk assessment process

&gt; "3. Gather information:  Create a comprehensive catalogue of inherent bribery risks to which the company could plausibly be exposed by virtue of the nature and location of its activities."

&gt; "4: Identify the bribery risks: The objective of this stage is to identify and examine the activities and risk factors that could increase the company’s exposure to bribery risk."

---

# Six stages for the anti-bribery risk assessment process

&gt; "5. Evaluate and prioritise the risks: The risk evaluation stage analyses and prioritises the forms of bribery identified in stage 3 taking into account the risk factors in stage 4. Common practice is to apply two variables to prioritise risks: likelihood of occurrence and the potential adverse impact."

&gt; "6. Use the output of risk assessment: The results of risk assessments are applied to a review of the anti-bribery programme and the extent to which existing controls need modification or additions."

---

# Stage 4: Identify the Bribery Risks

&gt; "Aim: Create a comprehensive risk register of inherent bribery risks, risk factors and bribery schemes to provide the basis for evaluation of risks in stage 5."

&gt; "Designing the register: Cataloguing risks requires identifying activities subject to bribery risks and the related risk factors. For instance, bidding for public contracts is an activity likely to be vulnerable to bribery and the risk is heightened if it takes place in a country known to have high levels of corruption. This could be exacerbated if it is in a sector known to be vulnerable to bribery. Thus the company needs to identify, based on information gathered in the previous stages, which of its activities could be subject to bribery risks and what are the risk factors that could make bribery more likely."

---

# Stage 4: Identify the Bribery Risks

&gt; "In this stage the company designs and populates a comprehensive risk register which captures and organises the information gathered in the previous stage 3. The register will provide the basis for the next stage of assessing and prioritising the identified risks. The aim here is to record the main forms of bribery risk that the company could be exposed to as broad evaluations and not related to particular contracts or third party relationships."

---

# Stage 4: Identify the Bribery Risks

* The Three Dimensions of Bribery Risks

1. Activity: The activity vulnerable to bribery, for example, bidding for a public contract.

1. Risk factor: An external or internal circumstance that could make it more likely that bribery will occur; for example, the country of operation.

1. Bribery scheme:  The way in which a bribe benefit - financial or non-financial - is transmitted. For example, bribery through gifts and hospitality.

# [Culture &amp; Tone from the Top](http://bit.ly/2C4MjYD)

&gt; "A corporate culture of ethics and integrity creates the enabling environment in which the anti-bribery programme operates. Without such an environment, the anti-bribery programme will operate in isolation without an ethical compass of corporate values or impetus for action.  The key contributing factors to an enabling environment are tone from the top, ethical leadership and employees who understand how they should act when faced with ethically challenging situations, and are motivated to do so."

---

# Key elements of culture &amp; tone from the top

* Culture of ethics and integrity: Employees know what is right and will know how to act when faced with ethical challenges.  The company encourages and supports employees to do the right thing.

* Alignment: The anti-bribery policy and programme are an expression of the corporate values.

* Tone from the top: The board and management carry the anti-bribery commitment throughout the company through their support, statements, behaviour and activities.

* Incentives: Design remuneration and incentives so that they do not inadvertently reward behaviour which undermines the company’s anti-bribery commitment.

* Speak-Up: Encourage a speak-up culture and provide confidential advice and speak-up lines for employees.

* Reward: Ensure good behaviour and speaking up is visibly rewarded and bad behaviour is visibly penalised.
